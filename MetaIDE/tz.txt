- web server
- clone git repository

idea:
  we have a code and we need meta information about code. 
  Sometimes we need ask about some chunk of code, or get help to improve some chunk of code
  

:
  - when viewing code on meta ide site, necessary get easy access to:
    - test code or create it code
    - easy navigation
    - easy view of user changes (CI for VCS)
    
  - certain line of code on the web page must have:
    - todo
    - forum
    - review request
    - tag
    
 - developer (dev) can:
   - send link to code to another developer

 another developer(dev2) can:
   - view current code of dev
   - correct chunk of code for dev
   - write or edit test for it code
   - write message (todo, fixme etc) that binding to code
   -
